# Sandbox: A Code Execution Plugin for ChatGPT

Sandbox is an experimental ChatGPT plugin that allows users to execute Python code on their local machines. With Sandbox, you can interact with your Python environment directly using natural language.

## Versions

Sandbox comes in three versions, each designed to meet different user needs and security preferences:

- **Protected**: The most secure version, implementing various safety measures such as Docker containerization, network isolation, and code sanitization.
- **Standard**: A middle ground offering Docker containerization without the additional security measures of the Protected version.
- **Source**: The least secure version, allowing Python code to be run directly on your machine without any security implementations.

## Warning

- *Use the Sandbox plugin at your own risk, especially the Source version. Always be cautious when running code from untrusted sources.*

## Contributions

- Contributions are welcome. Please submit an issue or pull request.
