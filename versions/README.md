# Overview of all versions of Sandbox

The Sandbox plugin was designed with customization in mind. This allows you to choose between 3 options;

1. Protected
  - This is the most secure, and probably will be the most updated. Make sure your version is up-to-date to avoid security gaps. This versions locks down everything. The container will self destruct after 30 minutes, limited system resources are provided to the Container, no internet access, and limited file access.

2. Standard
  - The middle ground. If you want security but not all the fancy features, then this version is for you. You only get the Docker Container, with no security features.

3. Source
  - The least secure. If you're a daredevil, and want to run Python code straight on your own machine, now you can.
